Diamond Price Predictor (Multimodal)
This project implements a sophisticated Diamond Price Predictor web application using Flask, capable of estimating diamond prices based on either tabular features alone or a combination of tabular features and a diamond image. It leverages a multimodal machine learning approach with a custom image feature extractor and a robust stacked regressor model.

✨ Features
Multimodal Prediction: Predicts diamond prices using both traditional tabular characteristics (carat, cut, clarity, etc.) and visual features extracted from an uploaded image.

Tabular-Only Prediction: Offers a separate prediction path for users who only have tabular data.

Intuitive Web Interface: A clean, modern, and aesthetically pleasing user interface built with HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS, providing a seamless user experience.

Robust Preprocessing: Utilizes scikit-learn pipelines for comprehensive data preprocessing, including imputation, scaling, and categorical encoding.

Image Feature Extraction: Employs a pre-trained ResNet50 convolutional neural network (tensorflow.keras.applications) to extract rich features from diamond images.

Stacked Regression Model: Leverages a Stacked Regressor for superior prediction accuracy, trained on log-transformed target variables to handle data skewness and ensure positive price predictions.

Dependency Management: Includes a requirements.txt for easy environment setup and reproducibility.

⚙️ Setup and Run Locally
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Diamond.git # Replace with your repo URL
cd Diamond

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Windows:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

macOS / Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies:
Once your virtual environment is activated, install all required packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Acquire Trained Models and Pipelines:
Ensure you have the following .joblib files in your project's root directory. These are the trained models and preprocessing pipelines:

full_preprocessing_pipeline.joblib

Tabular_XGBoost_model.joblib

full_multi_modal_preprocessing_pipeline.joblib

XGBoost_model.joblib

(If these are not provided in the repository due to size, you would typically include instructions here on how to download them, e.g., from a cloud storage link or by running a specific training script.)

Run the Flask Application:
With your virtual environment still active, run the Flask app:

python app.py

The application will start, and you should see output indicating that it's running on a specific address (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000).

💎 Usage
Access the Application: Open your web browser and navigate to the address shown in your terminal (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000).

Choose Input Method: You will be presented with an option to choose between "With Image (Multimodal)" or "Tabular Data Only".

Enter Data & Predict:

Tabular: Fill in all the diamond's tabular characteristics and click "Predict Tabular Price".

Multimodal: Fill in the tabular characteristics AND upload an image of the diamond. Click "Predict Multimodal Price".

View Prediction: The predicted price will be displayed on the page.

⚠️ Challenges & Learning
This project presented several common machine learning and deployment challenges:

Dependency Management: Navigating conflicting scikit-learn versions across different notebooks was a significant hurdle, emphasizing the importance of precise requirements.txt and isolated virtual environments.

Multimodal Input Handling: Integrating disparate data types (tabular and image) required careful pipeline design. The ColumnTransformer's expectation of an image_path column necessitated temporarily saving uploaded images to disk during inference to match the training pipeline's input structure.

Target Variable Transformation: Initial negative price predictions highlighted the necessity of np.log1p() transformation on the skewed 'Price' target variable during training, followed by np.expm1() inverse transformation during inference, to ensure sensible, positive price outputs.

Data Sparsity in High-Value Range: Despite a high overall R2 score (0.97 for the Stacked Regressor), the model demonstrated a tendency to underpredict extremely high diamond prices. This is attributed to the sparse distribution of high-value diamonds in the training dataset, a common challenge in real-world skewed data, where models learn best from the dense regions. This limitation was acknowledged as an area for future work rather than a flaw in the current implementation.

💡 Future Enhancements
Expand Dataset for High Values: Acquire more high-priced diamond data to improve prediction accuracy at the extreme ends of the price spectrum.

Fine-tune CNN for Diamond Features: Experiment with fine-tuning the ResNet50 model on a dataset of diamond images specifically for more relevant visual feature extraction.

Real-time Image Preprocessing: Explore in-memory image processing solutions to avoid temporary file storage if scalability becomes a concern.

User Authentication: Implement user login/registration.

Prediction History: Allow users to save and review past predictions.

Deployment to Cloud: Deploy the Flask application to a cloud platform (e.g., Google Cloud Run, AWS Elastic Beanstalk) for public access.
